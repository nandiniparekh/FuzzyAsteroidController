# Fuzzy Asteroid Controller
* Collaborated within a team to engineer a fuzzy control agent for Thales North America's Asteroids arcade game (version 1.3.6) as part of the Explainable Fuzzy Challenge (XFC) at the NAFIPS annual conference. The project involved designing a fuzzy controller utilizing a genetic algorithm for optimizing thrust, turn rate, and firing mechanisms, with the objective of outperforming the basic agent in the Kessler examples.
* Utilized a declarative approach in designing the fuzzy controller to effectively manage the ship's maneuvers, involving the determination of optimal parameters for the fuzzy logic rules.
* Integrated a genetic algorithm approach to fine-tune the fuzzy controller, aiming to optimize rule parameters and enhance the agent's in-game performance.
